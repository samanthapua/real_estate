Data Analytics Project for Real Estate

Plans:
1. Data Visualization for Melbourne Housing (Easy)
    - Data exploratory on tableau and streamlit
        - Country Area against Price: find the increment in price over time over against each region. Find out which region in which constantly has higher price. Find if the number of rooms affect
        - House area against price: rooms against price, carpark against price, landsize against price. bedrooms2-rooms(partition room) against price

2. Time Series Analysis (Average
   If the dataset includes a temporal dimension (e.g., monthly prices), you can perform time series analysis.
   Explore trends, seasonality, and use time series forecasting methods.

3. Predictive Modeling (Hard)
Use Python with scikit-learn or TensorFlow/PyTorch to build a predictive model for housing prices.
Evaluate different regression algorithms and choose the one with the best performance.
