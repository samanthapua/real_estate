Predictive Modeling:
Use Python with scikit-learn or TensorFlow/PyTorch to build a predictive model for housing prices.
Evaluate different regression algorithms and choose the one with the best performance.


Time Series Analysis:
If the dataset includes a temporal dimension (e.g., monthly prices), you can perform time series analysis.
Explore trends, seasonality, and use time series forecasting methods.
